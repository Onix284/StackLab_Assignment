Our character have to collect the strawberries while avoiding the traps and reach to the final destination.
MOVEMENTS ->
To move player forward and backward us A and D
To jump use SPACE Bar
If you want to quit and cloase the game then press ESCAPE Button


Overview ->
Developing a 2D platformer game in Unity that involves collecting items and avoiding traps is a common and exciting project. Here's a brief overview of the development process and the challenges i have faced:

1. **Concept and Design**:
   - Define the game concept: Determine the core gameplay mechanics, such as movement, collecting items (strawberries), and avoiding traps.
   - Sketch out the game's art style and level design, considering the platformer genre.

2. **Setting Up the Project**:
   - Create a new 2D project in Unity.
   - Import any necessary assets like sprites, sound effects, and music.

3. **Player Character**:
   - Design and implement the player character's mechanics, including movement, jumping, and collision detection.
   - Implement the code to handle player input (keyboard, gamepad, or touch controls).

4. **Level Design**:
   - Create and design the game levels using Unity's level editor or a third-party tool.
   - Place strawberries and death traps strategically to create engaging challenges.
   - Balance difficulty and progression as you add more levels.

5. **Collectibles**:
   - Implement logic for collecting strawberries, including collision detection between the player and the strawberries.
   - Keep track of the player's score and update the UI accordingly.

6. **Death Traps**:
   - Implement logic for detecting collisions between the player and traps.
   - Define what happens when the player touches a trap, such as restarting the level or subtracting from the player's lives.

7. **Animations**:
   - Create and import animation assets for the player character, strawberries, and traps.
   - Use Unity's Animation or Animator system to control the animations.
   - Transition between animations based on the game state (e.g., idle, walking, jumping).

8. **Challenges Faced**:
   - **Level Design**: Balancing the levels to ensure they are challenging but not frustrating can be a significant challenge. Playtesting and iterating on level designs are essential.
   - **Animations**: Managing and transitioning between multiple animations for the player character and objects can be complex, especially if you're new to Unity's animation system. This may involve creating animator controllers and defining transition conditions.
   - 
9. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test your game thoroughly to ensure that all mechanics work as intended.
   - Debug any issues, such as collision detection problems or animation glitches.

10. **Polishing**:
    - Add sound effects and background music to enhance the player's experience.
    - Consider adding additional features like power-ups or additional obstacles for variety.

11. **UI and Menus**:
    - Create user interfaces for the main menu, and game over screen.
